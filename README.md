### Tennis_Top30

For my Codeup Data Science Capstone I was on a team that predicted the outcome of tennis matches between two players on the ATP tour.  
In part of this project I looked to see if greatness can be predicted early in one's career.  Champions such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic were hard to predict early, as we found greatness was evolved over time.  Exploration showed key drivers of greatness to help predict Top 30 which this project aims to elaborate on.  This is an expansion of my capstone project in hopes to create a strong prediction model in whether or not a tennis player could be determined as a future Top 30 star early in their career.
